    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Once you learn the basics, you can turn out your own small-batch artisanal frozen desserts (you could totally call it that) in any flavor imaginable. Get ready, here's how to make ice cream at home.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and half of the sugar. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, stir together the cream, half-and-half, salt, and remaining sugar. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring often, until it comes to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture to the egg mixture while whisking constantly (this helps prevent the eggs from cooking). Repeat with another 1/2 cup of the cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir the cream mixture in the saucepan constantly as you pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and mixture coats the back of the spatula, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>
